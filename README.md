This is a little slideshow on "Modern OpenGL" (as of 2012) that I put together for my colleagues.  I hope you enjoy it.  Note that all the content in this repo is in the *gh-pages* branch.  If you find any mistakes, feel free to make a pull request.

You can re-use the presentation in any way, but I'd like you to give attribution to the *The Little Grasshopper*.  ([CC BY 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/))
