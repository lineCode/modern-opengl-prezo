Real-time shading in 2004
Real-time shading in 2012
Core Profile.  Mention Mobile.
Word Clouds.  Although vendors...I personally advocate.
Jurassic Vertices.
Modern Vertices.  Explain suffixes.
VAO's.  Mention VAO 0.
Buffer Objects.  In the beginning there were vertex buffers.
   Buffer Objects are untyped blobs of data.
   You give OpenGL a view upon that data by "binding" a buffer object to a target,
        then calling one of these commands.
        The classic example is GL_ARRAY_BUFFER.
   They're interchangeable and belong to one namespace.
   Some of the newer buffer target like UNIFORM have multiple binding points
Blocks
DEMO Tess
   Uniform Block (GLSL) - Then, Uniform Buffer (C)
   DSA
   Subroutines - First the GLSL, then the C
   Zero enabled attributes!
   Tessellation Shaders - 
       Emphasize parametric aspect.
       Emphasize Show the "Patch", Show the Shaders.
Binding Vertex Attribs
FragData
    Floating Point render target and representing something other than a vec4 color can be powerful, as you'll see in the next demo
Binding Fragment Outputs
DEMO Fluid
    Show 3D texture, glFramebufferTexture
    Show DrawInstanced
    Show Fluid.glsl -- passing instance, picking layer
Old Monolithic Program
New Separable Programs
Binaries!
Transform Feedback
    Point out Discard.  No frag shader!   DrawTransformFeedback.
Transform Feedback, multiple streams.
Transform Feedback, get back to CPU.
Textures - Quickly point out LUMINANCE is gone.
Compressed Textures
Texture Buffers
Pixel Buffers
DSA
Conditional Rendering
Image Load/Store
Stuff I missed

misc

Do an HTML cleanup, recentering, gen PDF etc

Spiral7 -- branch and refactor
    Use Zero-Vert VBO.
    Animated.  Instanced.  Fogged.
    http://glsl.heroku.com/e#2214.0
    Use a subroutine to swap to an animated bezier patch?

FluidSim -- branch and refactor

For tessellation shaders, we'll demo instead of slides?

D - done
T - to be done
* - needs work
: - on deck
P - punt
? - existence is tentative
C - done but cut from the deck
