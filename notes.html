 evince Fullscreen is nice cuz you can click without changing.

Real-time shading in 2004
Real-time shading in 2012
Core Profile.
     Profiles define subsets of OpenGL functionality targeted to specific application domains.
     Context is an encapsulation of all OpenGL API state.
     Mention Mobile.
Word Clouds.  Although vendors...I personally advocate.
Jurassic Vertices.
Modern Vertices.  Explain suffixes.
VAO's.  Mention VAO 0.
Buffer Objects.  In the beginning there were vertex buffers.
   Buffer Objects are untyped blobs of data.
   You give OpenGL a view upon that data by "binding" a buffer object to a target,
        then calling one of these commands.
        The classic example is GL_ARRAY_BUFFER.
   They're interchangeable and belong to one namespace.
   Some of the newer buffer target like UNIFORM have multiple binding points
Blocks.  GO FAST HERE
DEMO Tess.   Illustrative more than sexy.
   - Run demo as-is.  Kind of interesting thing: 0 VBOs.
                      The only data is sent to the card at every frame are a couple xform matrices and a float
>    Spiral.c -- glDrawArrays -- I'm drawing 256 quads
>    Spiral.glsl -- "1;" CHANGE TO 128
   - Talk about tessellation:
       - The relationship between the control shader and eval shader is confusing.
       - Control shader operates on cage verts and sets level-of-detail.
       - The eval shader operates AFTER new verts have been created
       - The eval shader is where you decide on the final location of your verts.
       - Control shader operates on *control* points
       - Eval shader *evaluates* a parametric function.
       - Typical example would be a bicubic patch, but in my case I'm creating this goofy horn
         shape, which is easily defined with parametric function.
       - It's important to realize that tessellation units do NOT perform progressive refinements
         like classic Catmull-Clark
       - The standard approach for render Catmull-Clark on the GPU is patch approximation,
   - Subroutines - Swap to a klein bottle in C
>    Spiral.glsl -- "spiral" SHOW two functions annotated with "subroutine"
>    Spiral.c -- "[surface]" CHANGE to klein
   - Talk about how to update uniforms
>    Spiral.c -- ""NormalMatrix""
     Old school, DSA, Then, Uniform Buffer
Binding Vertex Attribs
FragData
    Floating Point render target and representing something other than a vec4 color can be powerful, as you'll see in the next demo
    prman analogy is AOV
DEMO Fluid
    Introduction:
       No OpenCL.  The power of floating-point textures: ping-pong it such that it's a texture, then a FBO, etc
       It's re-creating a deep shadow map at every frame, raycasting a 3D texture, and it's performing 
       a series of jaCOHbi iterations to solve navier-stokes
    Show you where I'm generating a deep shadow map

>      Fluid.glsl -- "gl_InstanceID" -- "gl-Layer"

misc

Do an HTML cleanup, recentering, gen PDF etc

Spiral7 -- branch and refactor
    Use Zero-Vert VBO.
    Animated.  Instanced.  Fogged.
    http://glsl.heroku.com/e#2214.0
    Use a subroutine to swap to an animated bezier patch?

FluidSim -- branch and refactor

For tessellation shaders, we'll demo instead of slides?
