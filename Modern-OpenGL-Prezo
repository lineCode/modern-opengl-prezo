Design the slideshow to have speech accompaniment.  Limit the content of slides to Code, Diagrams, and Tables without Headings.  The audience should listen, not read.

Overview (2 slides)
--------
  Title Slide
    Target Audience: You used OpenGL back in the day and want to catch up.
    Disclaimer: won't go through everything.  Not necessarily focused on GLSL or on techniques.  This isn't comprehensive either.
  Summary Slide
    Brief History of OpenGL
    Whirlwind Tour of OpenGL 4.2
    Demos & Code Walkthroughs

Brief History (16 slides)
-------------
  10000 ft Pipeline Diagrams - 3 slides (VS+FS, VS+GS+FS, VS+GS+TCS+TES+FS)
  GLSL - 3 slides
    VS+FS             texture2D,ftransform            attribute/varying  gl_Position gl_VertexId gl_FragColor gl_FragData gl_ClipPlane gl_ModelviewProjection ....
    VS+GS+FS          texture2D,texelFetch            in/out layout      gl_Position gl_VertexId gl_FragColor gl_FragData gl_ClipDistance gl_PrimitiveId gl_FragColor gl_FragData ...
     ^--- the buck stops here for Apple.
    VS+GS+TCS+TES+FS  texture,textureSize,imageAdd    in/out layout lowp gl_Position gl_VertexId gl_PrimitiveId gl_TessCoord ...
    gray out all optional stuff (FS in 2nd and 3rd eras, GS always, gl_Position in 3rd era)
  Deprecated Functions - 1 slide (word cloud?)
  Some things never change - 1 slide (word cloud?)
    ClearColor, CullFace, PrimitiveMode, Blend, Depth Test (word cloud)
  (New Functions?)
  Vertex Submission - 8 slides
    Immediate Mode
    DLs - ShareLists 
    VBOs (interleaved and non-interleaved)
    Instancing
    VAOs
    Integer Formats
    Uberbuffers (will talk about PBO's more later)
    DrawAuto    (will talk about Transform Feedback more later)

Whirlwind Tour of 4.2 (16 slides)
---------------------
  Tessellation Shaders - 1 slide (lots of talk about streaming amplification, parametric evaluation rather than iterative subdivision)
  Texture Lookups in GLSL - 1 slide
  Texturing in the C API - 4 slides
     LUMINANCE -> RED etc
     Compressed formats
     16-32 Float / sRGB / Integer
     Pixel Buffer Objects (great for streaming; explain double-buffering). <-- there's also "texture buffers", no?  Explain ReadPixels-with-null.  Study DepthStencil and MS (impacts Florian)
  Shader Interfacing - 3 slides
     Three ways of allocating handles to shader in/out/uniforms: (1) Let GL create handles (2) Assign at the API level (3) Assign at the shader level
     Uniform Blocks / Uniforms Buffers
     Shader Interfaces
  Queries - 1 slide
  Image Load/Store - 1 slide
  Transform Feedback - 1 slide
  Two ways of doing MRT - 1 slide
     Individual color attachments, or individual FBOs
  FBOs - 2 slides
     Definition - collection of renderbuffers (complicates context sharing)
     2 ways of allocating
       From a texture, From a renderbuffer.  Z-only is valid (and FAST)
     Layered / Mipmapped. Framebuffers
  NV Bindless extensions - 1 slide

Demos & Code Walkthroughs
-----
Layered Framebuffers
Transform Feedback
Fresnel Glass Buddha?
Evolving a Torus
  Simple lit torus with Facet normals in GS
  Adding nice lines in the right place
  Adding some clip planes
  Adding a reflective sphere in the middle
  HDR and tonemapping
  Barrel Distortion
  Barrel Distortion in Tess Shader
